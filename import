#####R script to import data to R from CSV files####

w <-267 #excitation wave length is defined outside the experiment
N<-3 #number of probes, so far the script is tested on three probes
probes<-1:N
for (i in 1:N)
{
  df<- read.csv2(paste0(i,".csv"), header = TRUE);
  probes[[i]]<-c(i,w,df) #id, excitation wave length, the relation between registration wave length and intensity
}
#it works!
