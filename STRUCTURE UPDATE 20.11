NEW PLAN
- studies showed MongoDB cannot be used in this project because of irrational amounts of work that needs to be done in order to use it (even
when using Talend Studio)
- instead, new project plan requires:
DATA IMPORT MODULE
- converts data from .xls files to .csv files (probably C# app. Probably)
basic functions:
- read the info from folder name and add it to a file name
- create and additional .txt with folder names to be later imported into R
- folder names contains essential data!!
DATA STORAGE
- data is stored in .csv files

all other operations with data are performed in R. So far, R modules are being tested on the lesser amount of data
