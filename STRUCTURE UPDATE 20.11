NEW PLAN
- studies showed MongoDB cannot be used in this project because of irrational amounts of work that needs to be done in order to use it (even
when using Talend Studio)
- instead, new project plan requires:
DATA IMPORT MODULE
- converts data from .xls files to .csv files (probably C# app. Probably)
DATA STORAGE
- data is stored in .csv files

all other operations with data are performed in R. So far, R modules are being tested on the lesser amount of data
